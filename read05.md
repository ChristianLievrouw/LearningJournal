## What is CSS
CSS has many different cool things you can use to help style a website. You are able to do anything from change the style of a text to moving around different elements in your page. CSS is important because it helps your webpage be more attractive to your user and it helps grab their attention. Using CSS to mold your page can help with flow and getting the right information to you user. Without CSS your webpage would just be a mess of images and text running straight down the screen with no color or presentation.
## Why we use CSS
You can find CSS sometimes in the head of a html document, which is not recommended, or in a separate file which is the more common practice. The reason you should keep it in a separate file is that it make it easier to edit and keeps your code clean. If you were to have CSS in your html document you would have to make sure that you do that for each page that you create from then on. If CSS is placed in a separate folder you are able to control all elements of each page at the same time which helps updating and maintaining a site.
