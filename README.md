  I was born in Mason City, IA and grew up in Charles City, IA. I graduated from Charles City High School in 2011. I currently  work as a beer delievery driver for Kabrick Dist. My goal for Deltav is to have the growth mindset to go from just a delivery driver to a software developer with a growing and successful career.


## Growth Mindset

  The growth mindset to me is being open to *failing*, then **learning** from your failures. Always keep your head up and do not become discoraged. Learn from doing something wrong and be open to help from others and their opinions. When you set yourself up for a growth mindset you can accomplish anything.
### Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset
  1. Each failure is a oppurtunity to learn.
  2. Be open to help from others and their ideas.
  3. Never give up when obstacles present themselves.
