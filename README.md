  I was born in Mason City, IA and grew up in Charles City, IA. I graduated from Charles City High School in 2011. I currently  work as a beer delievery driver for Kabrick Dist. My goal for Deltav is to have the growth mindset to go from just a delivery driver to a software developer with a growing and successful career.


***Growth Mindset***

  Growth mindset to me is being open to *failing* and then **learning** from your failures. Always keep your head up and learn from doing something wrong and be open to help from others and their opinions.
### Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset
  1. Each failure is a oppurtunity to learn.
  2. Be open to others help and opinions.
  3. Never give up when you cant figure somthing out.
