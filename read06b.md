What makes a computer, a computer?one of the main things that make a computer, a computer is the ability to receive data, store the data, process the data, and then output a result. Input is anything that we, the user does to give the computer information. That data is then stored and processed until it is eventually sent back out to the user as output. Output can be anything from text, video, photos, or even virtual reality.

All of the information that goes in and out of a computer is stored and processed as binary code. Binary code is just a sequence of 1's and 0's. Images, videos, and even sound can be broke own into numbers and then stored using 1's and 0's.

Circuits are little electrical components inside of a computer that help process the 1's and 0's into an output source.

Hardware is composed of circuits, chips, wires, plugs, and much more. Software is the code given from apps, websites, maps, and much more. when bringing those two together you main thing you need is a cpu. a cpu is the central processing unit. the cpu is designed to take information and do things such as math, and receive information.
