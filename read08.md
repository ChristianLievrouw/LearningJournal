# Read: 08 - Operators and Loops
## comparison operators
In javascript you will find comparison operators. Comparison operators help us compare a value to wat we think it should be and tell us if it is true or false.
## Types of comparison operators
== (is equal to)
== = (strict equal to)
!= (is not equal to)
!== (strict not equal to)
'>,<' (greater than, less than)
'>=,=<' (greater than or equal to, less than or equal to)
## Logical operators 
Logical operators let us compare the result of more than one comparison operator.
## Types of comparison operators
&& (both expressions must be true to be returned as true)(logical and)
|| (one or both have to be true to return true)(logical or)
! (inverts boolean value)(logical not)
## Loops and counter loops
loops are helpful when you need to keep testing values until the return is false. counter loops help when you are needing to do a task a specific amount of times. Loops help us anywhere that you would have to tediously keep writing code so many times over and over again.
