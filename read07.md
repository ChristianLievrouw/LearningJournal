A helpful tool in javascript is a function. Functions allow you to store a sting on code to be called on in different places whenever needed. Functions work when you declare a function. Once the function is declared and a bit of code is set to run it you are able to call on that function. In functions you can either set the information it will need or you can get the information from and outside source such as a user.
