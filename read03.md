## What I learned from the teaching exercise.
In this exercise I learned how to pull my repository from GitHub to my local drive to edit it in Visual Studio. I learned how to check the status of my repository to make sure everything is running smooth. I feel with this exercise I learned how to navigate files through the terminal a little better. This exercise also help a little with problem solving. The first time through, I ended up bring my LearningJournal file down to a different folder instead of the desktop. With a little problem solving and understanding what the terminal was saying I then put the folder in the correct location. Last thing I took from this exercise is how to then push my new changes back to GitHub from my local drive.
