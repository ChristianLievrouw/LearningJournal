## What I learned from the teaching exercise.
In this exercise I learned how to pull my repository from GitHub to my local drive to edit it in Visual Studio. I am now able to check the status of my work in the terminal and better understand what the output is in the terminal. The exercise gave me a little better understanding of the terminal overall. I feel a little more confident when navigating through the terminal. I see how bringing your documents down to edit in a text editor could help quality of work and overall work flow.

I feel that I understand the process and how the move your work from GitHub to your local drive is accomplished. There is still some practice that needs to be done, but overall i am more confident with the procedure. Some things that I feel I need to work on are making sure I use the correct syntax in terminal and just get more familiar with what each action does.
